_Created in Spring 2024 for CS 326 by Enver Amboy, Matthew Kotchkin, Kaitlyn Malsky, Sreyas Rajasekharuni, and Shivay Wadhawan (group 40)._

VillageLink is a web application that makes it simpler and easier to make new friends on campus, with the help of pins that help you find out where and when people are hanging out, in real time. Using the application to meet new people will grow your _village_, consisting of a collection of the people you have met up with along the way. You can then go on to meet more people, growing your own village, and gaining access to the villages of other users. Villages serve as a fun, intuitive way to visualize social connections.

## How to use

### Map View

Creating an account will give you access to the map view, where you can see your own pins and other people's pins. To create a new pin, click the **Add Pin** button, which will add your new pin to the center of the map. You can drag this new pin to any location you want on the map. Once you have chosen a location for your pin, specify the start time, the end time, and details of the hangout you want to schedule and click **Post** when you're done. This will add your pin to the map and make it visible to other users. You can also edit and delete your existing pins by clicking it again. You can view other people's pins and click the **Join** button to become part of their group.

### Message view

Once you have joined in a meetup, you will be able to access the message view to communicate with other people from that group. Choose the group chat you want to communicate with using the sidebar on the left.

### Village view

This is where you can see your village, i.e. the people you have met on past hangouts. You can click a user to see their village. _You can't see the villages of people in your friend's villages - this system only extends to friends-of-friends, not friends-of-friends-of-friends_.

### Profile view

Customize your own profile by creating a cute animal avatar and changing your displayed name. This information will be visible to other users on the map, in your village, or in your friends' villages.
