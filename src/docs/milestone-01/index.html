                Our project is going to be an interactive map with the goal of reducing loneliness by bringing people
                that just want to hang out together. The user of this app will be able to put a pin on a map expressing
                that they want to hang out at some location and
                some time, and other people will be able to quickly and easily join their group. After using the
                application to find somebody, it will use the hangout information to build a social graph of people you
                spent time with, adding them to a
                “village” of people. Loneliness is a serious problem for college students and for the world as a whole;
                on a large campus like UMass many people have the problem of being physically surrounded by a lot of
                people but still feeling alone.
                Asking random strangers to be friends can be intimidating for so many people, and the aim of this
                project is to make meeting new people seem safe, fun, and approachable. The target audience of this
                project is college students, young adults,
                and just adults in general who struggle with making friends in their day-to-day lives.

                    <p>
                        An essential part of the application is the login system. Users must sign up before using our
                        web app and can only sign up using their UMass email for safety reasons. The user must enter
                        their name, a short bio that is capped at 200 characters, password,
                        and choose an avatar to represent themselves in the interface. The short bio could include age,
                        interests, and any other information the user considers relevant.

                    <h3>People Finder</h3>
                    <p>
                        The primary feature of VillageLink is the people finder. As the main page of the application,
                        the user is presented with a map-based view that highlights “pins”. Each pin represents a person
                        or group of people seeking to get other users to join them in
                        an activity or event. Users can create pins or select pins created by other users in order to
                        find other people. Pins created by users in your village are highlighted more than other users'
                        pins. Our web app also prioritizes pins
                        with very few people already joined, encouraging more users to join and grow those smaller
                        hangouts into larger social gatherings.

                    <p>
                        The second core feature is the village view. We believe that maintaining connections with people
                        is just as important as the initial connection itself. After attending an activity or an event
                        initiated through a pin, users have the ability to connect
                        with the others they met and add them to their personal village - a network representing their
                        real-world social connections. Thus, the village view allows users to stay in touch with other
                        users they have previously discovered.
                        Further, by navigating to the village page of other users in their village, the app will show
                        transitive and mutual connections, enabling users to better expand and manage their village
                        network.

                    <p>
                        The third key feature is messaging. Messaging allows users to converse with other users on the
                        platform who are interested in the same pins. Thus, any necessary meetup planning can occur
                        without leaving the bounds of the application. This ensures that
                        meetups can go smoothly as all planning can be accounted for in VillageLink.

            <div>
                <p>
                    The foundational data requirement of VillageLink is the database of members which have signed up for
                    our application. This includes the name of the member, accompanied by an avatar, a short bio and the
                    creation of a “village” for the user. This database
                    is the backbone of our application as it allows all the users on our application to interact with
                    each other and build our community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A village is a supplementary database which stores information about the people the user has
                    interacted with and the events organized and attended by the user. This feature allows users to find
                    friends of friends and connect with them. Users have full
                    control of the people that are a part of their village.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another data requirement of our application is the list of current events created by our members.
                    For each event the database will store the location of the event, details of the creator of the
                    event , and other information describing the event. The location
                    of the event allows the users in a close proximity to the event location to view the details of the
                    event. The details of the creator of the event allows the users who are a part of the creator’s
                    village to also view the event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The location of the member is used to allow the member to drop pins on the map and create events. It
                    is also used to interact with people in close proximity to the user. Events that are scheduled to
                    take place within a predefined range close to the user’s
                    location become visible to the user which allows the user to get all the details of the event and
                    possibly attend it.

                    students, the transition to a new environment and juggling responsibilities makes it especially
                    difficult to build real world connections.

                    Loneliness is now associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, stroke,
                    anxiety and depression. While social media apps have made it easier to interact with people
                    anywhere, they often fail to meet the fundamental need of in-person
                    relationships and a sense of community belonging.

                    Our web application aims to make it easier to find real world human interaction and help combat
                    loneliness that college students face by introducing them to other people seeking human interaction.
                    By allowing users to easily find and join casual hangouts
                    nearby, it provides a low-pressure way for people to meet people with common interests or people who
                    live in the same area (in our case Amherst). By reducing intimidation around meeting new people, our
                    app helps curate authentic connections.

                    The development of our application serves as a compelling embodiment of the Integrative Experience
                    (IE), weaving together diverse educational insights and practical applications to address the
                    widespread issue of loneliness. Being college students, we
                    are aware of the widespread issue of loneliness which affects a large population of students in this
                    country. Reflecting on the Sociology courses taken by our team, we know that loneliness can affect a
                    person's well-being and their
                    academic success. Our project draws upon interdisciplinary knowledge acquired through General
                    Education courses and specialized learning in the field of Computer Science and Sociology.

                <p>
                    Through the development process, we work collaboratively, combining our diverse skill sets to create
                    a cohesive platform that promotes social connections. This collaborative effort mirrors real-world
                    scenarios, preparing us for professional environments
                    where effective teamwork and communication are vital.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, our project offers a shared learning experience, allowing us to apply our cumulative
                    learning to address a significant societal issue. By reflecting on our educational journey and
                    understanding the value of our diverse courses, we gain insights
                    into the interconnectedness of our education, preparing us for lifelong learning and engagement in
                    addressing societal challenges. Through this integrative project, we not only contribute to
                    combating loneliness but also cultivate
                    a sense of community and connection, fostering personal growth and societal well-being.
