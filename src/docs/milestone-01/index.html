            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Our project is going to be an interactive map with the goal of reducing loneliness by bringing people that just want to hang out together. 
                The user of this app will be able to put a pin on a map expressing that they want to hang out at some location and some time, and other people will be able to quickly and easily join their group. 
                After using the application to find somebody, it will use the hangout information to build a social graph of people you spent time with, adding them to a “village” of people. 
                Loneliness is a serious problem for college students and for the world as a whole; on a large campus like UMass many people have the problem of being physically surrounded by a lot of people but still feeling alone. 
                Asking random strangers to be friends can be intimidating for so many people, and the aim of this project is to make meeting new people seem safe, fun, and approachable. 
                The target audience of this project is college students, young adults, and just adults in general who struggle with making friends in their day-to-day lives.</p>

            <h2>Application Parts</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Login</h3>
                <p>
                    An essential part of the application is the login system.
                    Users must sign up before using our web app and can only sign up using their UMass email for safety reasons.
                    The user must enter their name, a short bio that is capped at 200 characters, password
                    , and choose an avatar to represent themselves in the interface.
                    The short bio could include age, interests, and any other information the user considers relevant.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>People Finder</h3>
                <p>
                    The primary feature of VillageLink is the people finder.
                    As the main page of the application, the user is presented with a map-based view that highlights “pins”.
                    Each pin represents a person or group of people seeking to get other users to join them in an activity or event.
                    Users can create pins or select pins created by other users in order to find other people. 
                    Pins created by users in your village are highlighted more than other users' pins.
                    Our web app also prioritizes pins with very few people already joined, encouraging more users to join and grow those smaller hangouts into larger social gatherings.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Village View</h3>
                <p>
                    The second core feature is the village view.
                    We believe that maintaining connections with people is just as important as the initial connection itself.
                    After attending an activity or an event initiated through a pin, users have the ability to connect with the others they met and add them to their personal village 
                    - a network representing their real-world social connections.
                    Thus, the village view allows users to stay in touch with other users they have previously discovered. 
                    Further, by navigating to the village page of other users in their village, the app will show transitive and mutual connections, 
                    enabling users to better expand and manage their village network.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Messaging</h3>
                <p>
                    The third key feature is messaging.
                    Messaging allows users to converse with other users on the platform who are interested in the same pins.
                    Thus, any necessary meetup planning can occur without leaving the bounds of the application.
                    This ensures that meetups can go smoothly as all planning can be accounted for in VillageLink.

        <section id="data-requirements">
            <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
            <p>
                The foundational data requirement of VillageLink is the database of members which have signed up for our application.
                This includes the name of the member, accompanied by an avatar, a short bio and the creation of a “village” for the user.
                This database is the backbone of our application as it allows all the users on our application to interact with each other and build our community.
            </p>
            <p>
                A village is a supplementary database which stores information about the people the user has interacted with and the events organized and attended by the user.
                This feature allows users to find friends of friends and connect with them. 
                Users have full control of the people that are a part of their village.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another data requirement of our application is the list of current events created by our members. 
                For each event the database will store the location of the event, details of the creator of the event , and other information describing the event. 
                The location of the event allows the users in a close proximity to the event location to view the details of the event.
                The details of the creator of the event allows the users who are a part of the creator’s village to also view the event.
            </p>
            <p>
                The location of the member is used to allow the member to drop pins on the map and create events. It is also used to interact with people in close proximity to the user.
                Events that are scheduled to take place within a predefined range close to the user’s location become visible to the user which allows the user to get all the 
                details of the event and possibly attend it.

        <section id="real-world">
            <h2>Real World Connection</h2>
            <p>
                In today's world, the hyperconnectivity of the online world can make us feel as if we are constantly surrounded by other people. 
                Despite that, finding people to talk to or hang out with in person can be an extreme challenge. Loneliness is now a major public health crisis, 
                with studies showing over 60% of Americans report feeling lonely. For college students, the transition to a new environment and juggling responsibilities 
                makes it especially difficult to build real world connections.
            </p>
            <p>
                Loneliness is now associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, stroke, anxiety and depression. 
                While social media apps have made it easier to interact with people anywhere, they often fail to meet the fundamental need of in-person relationships 
                and a sense of community belonging. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our web application aims to make it easier to find real world human interaction and help combat loneliness that college students face by introducing 
                them to other people seeking human interaction. By allowing users to easily find and join casual hangouts nearby, it provides a low-pressure way for 
                people to meet people with common interests or people who live in the same area (in our case Amherst). By reducing intimidation around meeting new people,
                 our app helps curate authentic connections.

            <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
            <p>
                The development of our application serves as a compelling embodiment of the Integrative Experience (IE), weaving together diverse educational insights and practical applications to address the widespread issue of loneliness. 
                Being college students, we are aware of the widespread issue of loneliness which affects a large population of students in this country.
                Reflecting on the Sociology courses taken by our team, we know that loneliness can affect a person's well-being and their academic success.
                Our project draws upon interdisciplinary knowledge acquired through General Education courses and specialized learning in the field of Computer Science and Sociology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through the development process, we work collaboratively, combining our diverse skill sets to create a cohesive platform that promotes social connections. 
                This collaborative effort mirrors real-world scenarios, preparing us for professional environments where effective teamwork and communication are vital.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, our project offers a shared learning experience, allowing us to apply our cumulative learning to address a significant societal issue. 
                By reflecting on our educational journey and understanding the value of our diverse courses, we gain insights into the interconnectedness of our education, 
                preparing us for lifelong learning and engagement in addressing societal challenges. Through this integrative project, we not only contribute to combating 
                loneliness but also cultivate a sense of community and connection, fostering personal growth and societal well-being.
