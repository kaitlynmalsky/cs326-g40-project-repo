          Our project is going to be an interactive map with the goal of
          reducing loneliness by bringing people that just want to hang out
          together. The user of this app will be able to put a pin on a map
          expressing that they want to hang out at some location and some time,
          and other people will be able to quickly and easily join their group.
          After using the application to find somebody, it will use the hangout
          information to build a social graph of people you spent time with,
          adding them to a “village” of people. Loneliness is a serious problem
          for college students and for the world as a whole; on a large campus
          like UMass many people have the problem of being physically surrounded
          by a lot of people but still feeling alone. Asking random strangers to
          be friends can be intimidating for so many people, and the aim of this
          project is to make meeting new people seem safe, fun, and
          approachable. The target audience of this project is college students,
          young adults, and just adults in general who struggle with making
          friends in their day-to-day lives.

            <h3>Login</h3>
            <p>
              An essential part of the application is the login system. Users
              must sign up before using our web app and can only sign up using
              their UMass email for safety reasons. The user must enter their
              name, a short bio that is capped at 200 characters, password, and
              choose an avatar to represent themselves in the interface. The
              short bio could include age, interests, and any other information
              the user considers relevant.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="collapsible">
            <h3>People Finder</h3>
            <p>
              The primary feature of VillageLink is the people finder. As the
              main page of the application, the user is presented with a
              map-based view that highlights “pins”. Each pin represents a
              person or group of people seeking to get other users to join them
              in an activity or event. Users can create pins or select pins
              created by other users in order to find other people. Pins created
              by users in your village are highlighted more than other users'
              pins. Our web app also prioritizes pins with very few people
              already joined, encouraging more users to join and grow those
              smaller hangouts into larger social gatherings.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section class="collapsible">
            <h3>Village View</h3>
            <p>
              The second core feature is the village view. We believe that
              maintaining connections with people is just as important as the
              initial connection itself. After attending an activity or an event
              initiated through a pin, users have the ability to connect with
              the others they met and add them to their personal village - a
              network representing their real-world social connections. Thus,
              the village view allows users to stay in touch with other users
              they have previously discovered. Further, by navigating to the
              village page of other users in their village, the app will show
              transitive and mutual connections, enabling users to better expand
              and manage their village network.
            </p>

          <section class="collapsible">
            <h3>Messaging</h3>
            <p>
              The third key feature is messaging. Messaging allows users to
              converse with other users on the platform who are interested in
              the same pins. Thus, any necessary meetup planning can occur
              without leaving the bounds of the application. This ensures that
              meetups can go smoothly as all planning can be accounted for in
              VillageLink.

        <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            The foundational data requirement of VillageLink is the database of
            members which have signed up for our application. This includes the
            name of the member, accompanied by an avatar, a short bio and the
            creation of a “village” for the user. This database is the backbone
            of our application as it allows all the users on our application to
            interact with each other and build our community.
          </p>
          <p>
            A village is a supplementary database which stores information about
            the people the user has interacted with and the events organized and
            attended by the user. This feature allows users to find friends of
            friends and connect with them. Users have full control of the people
            that are a part of their village.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another data requirement of our application is the list of current
            events created by our members. For each event the database will
            store the location of the event, details of the creator of the event
            , and other information describing the event. The location of the
            event allows the users in a close proximity to the event location to
            view the details of the event. The details of the creator of the
            event allows the users who are a part of the creator’s village to
            also view the event.
          </p>
          <p>
            The location of the member is used to allow the member to drop pins
            on the map and create events. It is also used to interact with
            people in close proximity to the user. Events that are scheduled to
            take place within a predefined range close to the user’s location
            become visible to the user which allows the user to get all the
            details of the event and possibly attend it.

                The user will be prompted with a login page when entering the
                application for the first time. The user can choose to enter
                their username and password or to create a new account. For
                security, the user can not access the rest of the application
                without an account.

                The user inputs their unique username, email address, and

              <p>
                To create a new pin on the map, the user will press the “+” icon
                on the bottom right of the map and then choose a location on the
                map to place a pin on. Once the user chooses a location, they
                will then add an event start time, end time, and details that
                other users will be able to read when looking at their pin on
                the map.

        <h2>Real World Connection</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            In today's world, the hyperconnectivity of the online world can make
            us feel as if we are constantly surrounded by other people. Despite
            that, finding people to talk to or hang out with in person can be an
            extreme challenge. Loneliness is now a major public health crisis,
            with studies showing over 60% of Americans report feeling lonely.
            For college students, the transition to a new environment and
            juggling responsibilities makes it especially difficult to build
            real world connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Loneliness is now associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular
            disease, dementia, stroke, anxiety and depression. While social
            media apps have made it easier to interact with people anywhere,
            they often fail to meet the fundamental need of in-person
            relationships and a sense of community belonging.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our web application aims to make it easier to find real world human
            interaction and help combat loneliness that college students face by
            introducing them to other people seeking human interaction. By
            allowing users to easily find and join casual hangouts nearby, it
            provides a low-pressure way for people to meet people with common
            interests or people who live in the same area (in our case Amherst).
            By reducing intimidation around meeting new people, our app helps
            curate authentic connections.

            The development of our application serves as a compelling embodiment
            of the Integrative Experience (IE), weaving together diverse
            educational insights and practical applications to address the
            widespread issue of loneliness. Being college students, we are aware
            of the widespread issue of loneliness which affects a large
            population of students in this country. Reflecting on the Sociology
            courses taken by our team, we know that loneliness can affect a
            person's well-being and their academic success. Our project draws
            upon interdisciplinary knowledge acquired through General Education
            courses and specialized learning in the field of Computer Science
            and Sociology.

            Through the development process, we work collaboratively, combining

            Lastly, our project offers a shared learning experience, allowing us
            to apply our cumulative learning to address a significant societal
            issue. By reflecting on our educational journey and understanding
            the value of our diverse courses, we gain insights into the
            interconnectedness of our education, preparing us for lifelong
            learning and engagement in addressing societal challenges. Through
            this integrative project, we not only contribute to combating
            loneliness but also cultivate a sense of community and connection,
            fostering personal growth and societal well-being.
